## INFO

I want to learn more deeply about modern computation and building a language in C definitely seems like the ticket! This is currently a follow along of the blog here as of right now -> https://buildyourownlisp.com/ but I plan to add my own personal spin as I learn more C and as I am able to :)

windows compilation:
compile with gcc -> `gcc -std=c99 ./src/* -o ./build/lispy.exe `
run -> `start ./build/lispy.exe`

linux/macos compilation:
TBW
